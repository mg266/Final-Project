# DEPRECATED, MOVED TO https://github.com/Augumat/MP6

The first file, waow

Most of our code is going to be in app/src etc..

To Do List:
1. Make a question class -> store the values associated with it to select the category of Pokemon you’d get 
2. Remove legendaries, evolutions, pseudo-legendary 
3. Joke mode —> no matter what you choose, you’ll get magicarp.
